title: Accessibility statement for Manage school placements
---

This service is run by the Becoming a Teacher team at the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use the service. For example, that means users should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the service using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the service using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the content on the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the text on the service as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Technical information about this service’s accessibility

The Becoming a Teacher team (DfE) is committed to making Manage school placements accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

The service was designed using the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/), which conforms to the WCAG 2.1 AA standard. To ensure the service fully meets the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, we are currently arranging an accessibility audit. We will update this page following the audit, and publish details of any accessibility issues identified.
