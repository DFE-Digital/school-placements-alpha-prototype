We value and support the wellbeing of all individuals who train, work and learn in our schools. As such, we provide equality of opportunity and experience for all within a safe and secure learning environment. We work hard to provide tailored support to meet individual needs which equip our trainees with the skills and support needed to succeed in their training. We understand that disclosing a disability can be difficult. We work in partnership with the university and specialists within the Trust to support individuals with a variety of needs. Information is treated as confidential and only shared with those required to make necessary arrangements. Working directly with the university, we support our trainees to access the expertise of disability advisers, specialist mentoring as well as services pertaining to diagnostic and needs assessments."}
